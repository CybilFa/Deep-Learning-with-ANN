# Deep-Learning-with-ANN
This repository brings together several hands-on ANN-based machine learning models developed using Python, Keras, and TensorFlow. Each project tackles a distinct real-world problem—from detecting cancer and fraud to predicting stock prices and analyzing emotions—showcasing the flexibility and power of artificial neural networks.
